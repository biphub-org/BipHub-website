/**
 * BIP state machine validator (per D-06 from 03-CONTEXT.md).
 *
 * Application-layer enforcement of allowed (from, to, actor) transitions.
 * The DB has a CHECK constraint on `status` enum values but no transition
 * constraint — this module is the authoritative source for "which moves
 * are legal."
 *
 * Security: T-03-03 mitigation — coordinators cannot exploit a direct
 * `rejected → pending` move; their only path back to `pending` is via
 * `submitBipAction`, which calls validateTransition('draft', 'pending',
 * 'coordinator') after the RLS-enforced `bips_update_own_editable` policy
 * has forced status='draft' on save.
