# Requirements: BipHub

**Defined:** 2026-05-09
**Core Value:** Students can reliably discover Erasmus+ BIPs by country, field of study, and dates, and universities can self-service list their BIPs through a fast, professional submission flow with admin review.

## v1 Requirements

- [ ] **AUTH-06**: Coordinator session persists across browser refreshes (Supabase SSR cookies)
- [ ] **AUTH-07**: Coordinator can complete profile setup (university, country, Erasmus code, full name, contact email)

### Submission

- [ ] **SUBM-01**: Coordinator can submit a BIP through a multi-step wizard (not one giant form)

- [ ] **ADMN-11**: Admin receives Resend email when a new BIP is submitted

### Foundation (Non-Functional)

- [ ] **FOUN-01**: Every Supabase table has `ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` with policies covering SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE per role (anon, coordinator, admin) — every UPDATE policy includes both `USING` and `WITH CHECK`
- [ ] **FOUN-02**: Homepage and `/bips` achieve Lighthouse > 90 on Performance, Accessibility, SEO; LCP < 1.5s on 4G mobile
- [ ] **FOUN-03**: Site meets WCAG AA: forms keyboard-navigable, ARIA labels present, Europe map has country `<select>` fallback for keyboard users

- [ ] **FOUN-06**: Site has a privacy policy page covering data processing for EU users
- [ ] **FOUN-07**: Coordinator can delete their account; approved BIPs are anonymized, drafts deleted (GDPR right to erasure)
- [ ] **FOUN-08**: Repository is open-source with MIT license, README, and CONTRIBUTING.md
- [ ] **FOUN-09**: Local dev setup is `supabase start` + `npm run dev` with seeded data, no extra steps
- [ ] **FOUN-10**: Playwright E2E suite covers: auth flow, submission wizard, admin approve/reject, map click-to-filter

## v2 Requirements

### Student Features

- **STUD-01**: Student accounts with cross-device bookmark sync
- **STUD-02**: Student deadline reminders by email
- **STUD-03**: Save and share BIP filter list via URL

### Platform Features

- **PLAT-01**: Public API for external consumers
- **PLAT-02**: Multilingual UI (i18n)
- **PLAT-03**: Automated BIP data import from official EU sources
- **PLAT-04**: PDF export of BIP info
- **PLAT-05**: University photo uploads (replaces gradient placeholders)

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| In-platform application submission | Erasmus+ applications must legally route through the sending institution's Erasmus office; BipHub is a directory, not a funding-chain participant |
| University-to-university messaging | High complexity, low core value, would compete with existing university CRMs |
| BIP reviews / ratings | BIPs change year to year; negative reviews carry institutional politics consequences |
| Payment processing | Erasmus+ funds students directly via their home university; BipHub never handles money |
| "Erasmus+ official verified" badges | EC affiliation language is restricted; misrepresentation risk |
| Official 12-star EU emblem in any form | Restricted under EC visual identity rules; palette only |
| Real-time chat | High complexity, not core to discovery/listing value |
| Video posts on BIPs | Storage/bandwidth cost, defer to v2+ if ever |
| Mobile native app | Web-first; Next.js + responsive design covers mobile |
