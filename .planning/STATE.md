# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-08)

**Core value:** Students can reliably discover Erasmus+ BIPs by country, field of study, and dates, and universities can self-service list their BIPs through a fast, professional submission flow with admin review.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Discovery Foundation

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Init: Use `motion` (not `framer-motion`), Zod v3 (not v4), `@vnedyalk0v/react19-simple-maps` (not original), Next.js 15.5.x LTS (not 16)
- Init: GeoJSON served from `/public` at runtime via `dynamic()` — never imported into JS bundle
- Init: `getClaims()` everywhere in server code — never `getSession()`; `await cookies()` in all client factories
- Init: Seed-first Phase 1 — 20 SQL-seeded approved BIPs unblock student discovery before coordinator pipeline exists
- Init: Logo star count must be verified ≠ 12 before Phase 1 homepage build

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Logo star ring: verify star count ≠ 12 before Phase 1 homepage component is built; document in CONTRIBUTING.md
- erasmusbip.org ToS: review before any seed scraping script is written; fallback is coordinator-outreach seed strategy
- `@supabase/ssr` is `^0.x` beta — pin exact minor version; monitor changelog before upgrading
- Zod v4 / `@hookform/resolvers` compatibility — recheck before Phase 2 starts
