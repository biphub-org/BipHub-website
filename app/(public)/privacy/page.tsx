/**
 * /privacy — static privacy policy page (RSC).
 *
 * Implements FOUN-06 (privacy policy page) and documents the FOUN-05 posture
 * (zero analytics, no consent banner needed) per Phase 4 D-01 / D-02 / D-03 in
 * 04-CONTEXT.md.
 *
 * Per the locked structure in 04-CONTEXT.md (D-03):
 *  - Pure RSC (no 'use client'), `force-static` revalidation.
 *  - 8 content sections in the locked order: Data Controller, What we collect,
 *    Legal basis, Retention, Your rights, How to exercise, Children, Updates.
 *  - 600–900 word target body.
 *  - Enumerates every storage surface: Supabase Auth cookies, biphub:bookmarks,
 *    bip-draft, bips table content, profiles table.
 *  - Documents zero analytics, no third-party trackers, no marketing pixels.
 *  - Names team@hexonasystems.com as the data controller contact.
 *  - No consent banner is shipped or linked because no consent-requiring
 *    cookies/scripts are loaded.
 *
 * Reached via a footer link added in Plan 04-02 Task 2.

            When you sign in as a university coordinator, our authentication
            provider (Supabase) sets HTTP-only cookies that keep you signed in
            across page loads. These cookies are strictly necessary for the
            sign-in feature to function and are exempt from consent under EU

            <code>bip-draft</code> key holds an in-progress BIP submission so
            you do not lose your work if your session expires mid-form. Both are

            When a university coordinator registers, we store their full name,
            contact email, university affiliation, and Erasmus institutional
            code. When they submit a BIP, we store the submission content
            (programme title, description, dates, contact details they wish to
            publish, and so on). Approved submissions are published as part of
            the public Erasmus+ directory.

            storing the account. For published BIP submissions, the legal basis
            is legitimate interest (Art 6(1)(f) GDPR) in maintaining a public
            Erasmus+ directory benefiting students across Europe. We do not rely
            on consent for any data processing in v1 because we collect no
