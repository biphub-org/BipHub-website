          <p>
            BipHub is a free, open-source directory of Erasmus+ Blended
            Intensive Programmes (BIPs) operated by Hexona Systems. It is an
            independent project and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or
            officially connected to the European Commission, the Erasmus+
            National Agencies, or any participating university. References to
            Erasmus+ are descriptive only.
          </p>
          <p>
            By accessing or using BipHub, you agree to these terms. If you do
            not agree, please do not use the service.

          <p>
            Browsing the public directory is open to anyone. Submitting BIPs is
            reserved for staff at higher-education institutions participating in
            Erasmus+ &mdash; typically programme coordinators, international
            officers, or academic staff with authority to publicise the
            programme on behalf of their institution. By creating a coordinator
            account you confirm that you have that authority and that the
            content you submit is accurate to the best of your knowledge.

        <div className="mt-4 text-ink-2 leading-relaxed space-y-4">
          <p>
            BipHub publishes programme information supplied by coordinators or
            sourced from publicly available institutional materials. We review
            submissions for obvious errors but we do not independently verify
            every field. Dates, ECTS values, eligibility rules, application
            deadlines, and funding levels can change without notice. Always
            confirm details with the host institution and your own Erasmus+
            office before you act on a listing.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are not a party to any application, learning agreement, or
            mobility arrangement between you and a university. BipHub does not
            handle applications, payments, grants, or travel logistics.

            <li>
              Submit content you do not have the right to publish, or that

            </li>
            <li>
              Use the directory to send unsolicited bulk communications,
              advertise unrelated services, or run automated scraping that
              degrades the service for others.
            </li>
            <li>
              Attempt to bypass authentication, access other coordinators&apos;
              drafts, or circumvent the review queue.
            </li>
            <li>
              Upload content that infringes intellectual-property rights, is
              defamatory, or violates applicable law.

            The BipHub software is published under the MIT licence and the
            source code is available on GitHub. The MIT licence covers the code
            only &mdash; it does not transfer rights to the BipHub name, logo,
            or content submitted by coordinators. The visual identity uses the
            standard Erasmus+ colour palette; the logo deliberately uses a star
            count different from the 12-star European emblem to avoid implying
            EU endorsement.
